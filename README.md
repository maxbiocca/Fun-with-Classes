# Fun-with-Classes
I developed a short game using classes and utilizing a Markov Chain model

**Intro**
With the intent to develop some experience I developed a Markov Chain model to predict user behaviour navigating a supermarket and the used the developed user behaviour model to write a little game with the help of classes. 

**Object**
The main object was to explore the use of classes with something fun as writing a video game. At the same time I wanted to acquire some technical skills implementing the Markov Chain model.

**Plot**
Initially I started developing the Markov Chain model with the intent to deploy it, to optimise the store displacement. But during the development somebody said something about Pikachu, the iconic Pokemon out of the 2000s, attacking somebody with a knife. I found this idea so funny (picturing a Pikachu that really left himself go) that I decided to convert my supermarket marketing optimisation model into a game. Each player has 3 lives, will move around the supermarket according to the Markov Chain model and Pikachu is on the hunt with a knife. Each visited room gives points and extra points can be gathered by surviving the killing shopping experience. 

**Method**
The game has been developed using 2 classes one describing the game and one the players, including the murderous Pikachu. Each player has 3 lives and no possible action beside starting each life. 

**Next Steps**
The game could be further developed implementing a visual interface and a possibility for the player to influence the actions. I really would like to maintain the marketing-simulation part, maybe even incorporating some life data like for example data from google trends. This has the purpose of giving the player an intuition regarding the possible main factors piloting the killer through the supermarket.
